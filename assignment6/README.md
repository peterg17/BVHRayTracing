# Assignment 4 Writeup

## Running Code
From the root directory, `cd` into the build folder, then run `cmake ..` and `make`, which will produce the binary called "assignment4". Then you can run the test cases like in the handout. Also, there is a pre-compiled binary of my final code in the root directory called "assignment4". I have only tested my code on Macos which is the OS that i run. Also, I have included 800x800 images of the test cases as asked on piazza named "01.png", "02.png", ... in the root directory.

## Collaboration
Did not collaborate with anyone outside of office hours/piazza

## References
Mainly used the lectures slides for ray casting and ray tracing.

## Bugs
In my shadow code, I noticed that the last test case is a tad darker than it should be. I think that there is a problem with how my point light illumination works because even without the shadows, it is not at bright at the left side of the arch as it should be. I would debug this further. I plan to look into it if i do a project that builds on the ray tracer we have built.

## Extra Credit
N/A

## Comments
I thought that this was a really cool assignment and seems super important to understand this stuff to have a good background in graphics. I think it would be cool to do a project related to this.
